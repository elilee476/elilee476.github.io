# An event study on Loper Bright: How did markets react to a change in admin law doctrine?

## Is Admin Law Epiphenomenal? 

One of the best words that gets thrown around a lot at Yale Law School is "epiphenomenal." If you ever find yourself in a Yale Law School classroom, and you don't know what's going on, just raise your hand and ask "excuse me professor, but isn't this epiphenomenal?" Your question will be hailed as very intelligent and insightful.

All jokes aside, the question of whether, to what degree, and how legal doctrine is epiphenomenal is actually quite fundamental and interesting. If legal decisionmaking is driven by forces other than the nature of doctrine, it would be quite important for a practicing lawyer to have an understanding of these forces.

I want to offer a brief contribution to this discussion by looking at how markets reacted (or didn't react ) to what many legal scholars regard as a major change in administrative law doctrine. What's interesting is that scholars on *both* sides of the debate--both liberal defenders and conservative critics of the admin state--agreed that the Supreme Court's (the EXTREME Court's) decision in *Loper Bright* worked a major change in the balance of power between the administrative state and judiciary. 

*Examples*

The wonderful thing about *Loper Bright* is that these kinds of dire predictions are empirically testable. 

## Some Background on the case

I actually don't really know exactly what *Loper Bright* said (you can think of this post as an apology for my indifference to these kinds of minutia).  It's generally perceived as having overruled a legal doctrine called *Chevron* deference which required courts to defer to agencies' interpretations of statutes as long as the statute was ambigious and the interpretation is reasonable. *Loper Bright*--as far as I can tell--got rid of this system and created a new doctrine that requires courts to impose their own interpretations of statutes when reviewing administrative agency actions.

In other words, what *Loper Bright* does is alter the formal process by which courts justify their decisions about whether and how to supervise the administrative state. If you're tempted by the thought that such decisions are mere epiphenomena, i.e. that they are reflections of other forces and have little or no causal weight of their own, then you wouldn't think that changing the formal processes by which courts arrive at these decisions would matter very much. That's precisely the hypothesis I intend to test.

## My method 

In securities litigation, a method called an event study is used to test whether a development created a material change in the price of a security. For example, in an insider trading case, in order to decide whether a piece of information that an insider possessed was significant to the stock price of a company, the prosecution would use an event study to demonstrate that when the news was revealed, the company's stock price changed. 

The principle behind an event study on a single security is to isolate the changes in that securities' price which are unique to that security. The movement of stock prices of comparable companies are used to isolate changes that were unique to the specific security being studied as distinguished from macro trends like changes in interest rates or foreign exchange rates.

My aim is to replicate the logic of event studies to see whether the announcement of the *Loper Bright* created a significant change in the areas of the U.S. economy most subject to regulation. If *Loper Bright* really redistributes power away from the administrative state either to Congress (as its defenders on the right would say) or the judiciary (as its left-wing critics would have it), then we should expect highly-regulated industries to have a better economic future. This is because both of the institutions I mentioned (Congress and the judiciary) are more conservative than the administrative state, so if they have more power over the behavior of regulators, then we should expect regulations to be more lenient and therefore more profit for highly-regulated industries.

I don't want to pretend that my method is the most statistically sophisticated one out there. I'm sure that there's other and better ways to study how a court decision affected markets' perceptions of certain industries fortunes. But understanding the precise way in which markets reacted to *Loper Bright* is not exactly my objective here. Instead, I just want to show that it did not create any major changes in the fortunes of America's highly-regulated industries. That seems like enough to provide evidence in favor of the view that administrative law doctrine is epiphenomenal and has limited to no causal power of its own. 

A final elephant in the room that has to be addressed is the efficient market hypothesis (EMH). My argument requires some form of the EMH to make the deductive leap from the perspective implicit in market movements to the actual truth of how the decision affected the economy. Some formalists may want to say that if markets didn't react to *Loper Bright*, that's just because markets are wrong and don't understand how significant it is. 

All I have to say to that is that without being committed to any particular version, strong or weak, of the EMH, if you really think that the markets got this wrong, then you're a genius investor, and you can make billions of dollars by trading on your superior insight. You could also win a Nobel Prize for finding such clear evidence of the EMH being wrong in an area where it should be relatively strong (U.S. markets are very liquid and extensive). Anyone who is attracted by the argument I mentioned in the previous paragraph should seriously consider how likely those propositions are to be true. 

## Results



## Takeaways

It's easy to dismissively admin law as epiphenomenal, and I certainly think that my event study provides strong support for that view, but the question is what does that actually mean and why is it true.
