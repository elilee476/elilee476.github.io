# An event study on Loper Bright: How did markets react to a change in admin law doctrine?

## Is Admin Law Epiphenomenal? 

One of the best words that gets thrown around a lot at Yale Law School is "epiphenomenal." If you ever find yourself in a Yale Law School classroom, and you don't know what's going on, just raise your hand and ask "excuse me professor, but isn't this epiphenomenal?" Your question will be hailed as very intelligent and insightful.

All jokes aside, the question of whether, to what degree, and how legal doctrine is epiphenomenal is actually quite fundamental and interesting. If legal decisionmaking is driven by forces other than the nature of doctrine, it would be quite important for a practicing lawyer to have an understanding of these forces.

I want to offer a brief contribution to this discussion by looking at how markets reacted (or didn't react) to what many legal scholars regard as a major change in administrative law doctrine. What's interesting is that scholars on *both* sides of the debate--both liberal defenders and conservative critics of the admin state--agreed that the Supreme (EXTREME) Court's decision in *Loper Bright* worked a major change in the balance of power between the administrative state and judiciary. 

*Examples*

The wonderful thing about *Loper Bright* is that these kinds of dire predictions are empirically testable. 

## Some Background on the case

I actually don't really know exactly what *Loper Bright* said (you can think of this post as an apology for my indifference to these kinds of minutia).  It's generally perceived as having overruled a legal doctrine called *Chevron* deference which required courts to defer to agencies' interpretations of statutes as long as the statute was ambigious and the interpretation is reasonable. *Loper Bright*--as far as I can tell--got rid of this system and created a new doctrine that requires courts to impose their own interpretations of statutes when reviewing administrative agency actions.

In other words, what *Loper Bright* does is alter the formal process by which courts justify their decisions about whether and how to supervise the administrative state. If you're tempted by the thought that such decisions are mere epiphenomena, i.e. that they are reflections of other forces and have little or no causal weight of their own, then you wouldn't think that changing the formal processes by which courts arrive at these decisions would matter very much. That's precisely the hypothesis I intend to test.

## My method 

In securities litigation, a method called an event study is used to test whether a development created a material change in the price of a security. For example, in an insider trading case, in order to decide whether a piece of information that an insider possessed was significant to the stock price of a company, the prosecution would use an event study to demonstrate that when the news was revealed, the company's stock price changed. 

The principle behind an event study on a single security is to isolate the changes in that securities' price unique to that security. The movement of stock prices of comparable companies are used to isolate changes that were unique to the specific security being studied as distinguished from macro trends like changes in interest rates or industry-wide developments.

My aim is to replicate the logic of event studies to see whether the announcement of the *Loper Bright* created a significant change in the areas of the U.S. economy most subject to regulation. If *Loper Bright* really redistributes power away from the administrative state either to Congress (as its defenders on the right would say) or the judiciary (as its left-wing critics would have it), then we should expect highly-regulated industries to receive more favorable regulatory treatment and generate more value for their investors. This is because both of the institutions I mentioned (Congress and the judiciary) are more conservative than the administrative state, so if they gain more power to supervise regulators in the administrative state, then we should expect regulations to end up more lenient and therefore allow more profit in highly-regulated industries.

I don't want to pretend that my method is the most statistically sophisticated one out there. I'm sure that there's other and better ways to study how a court decision affected markets' perceptions of certain industries fortunes. But understanding the *precise* way details of how markets reacted to *Loper Bright* is not my objective here. Instead, I just want to show that it did not create any big changes in (investors' perceptions of) the fortunes of America's highly-regulated industries. That seems like enough to provide evidence in favor of the view that administrative law doctrine is epiphenomenal and has somewhere between limited to zero causal power of its own. 

A final elephant in the room that has to be addressed is the efficient market hypothesis (EMH). My argument requires some form of the EMH to make the deductive leap from the perspective implicit in market movements to the actual truth of how the decision affected the economy. Some legal scholars ~~who spend too much time baking their brains on caselaw~~ may want to say that if markets didn't react to *Loper Bright* by adjusting the valuations of highly-regulated inustries, that's just because the markets are wrong and don't understand how significant the decision was. 

All I have to say to that is that without being committed to any particular version, strong or weak, of the EMH, if you really think that the markets analyzed the decision incorrectly, then you're a genius investor, and you can make billions of dollars by trading on your superior insight. You could also win a Nobel Prize for finding such clear evidence of the EMH being wrong in an area where it should be relatively strong (U.S. markets are highly liquid and secure). Anyone who is attracted by the argument I mentioned in the previous paragraph should seriously consider how likely those propositions are to be true. 

## Results



## Takeaways

I would summarize these results as supporting three propositions:
1. The markets don't think *Loper Bright* affected the fortunes of highly-regulated industries in any decisive way.
2. Either that is the correct assessment or you are a genius hedge fund investor (EMH).
3. If *Loper Bright* did not affect any highly-regulated industries' fortunes, then it's not very plausible that insufficently-constraining legal results are responsible for the administrative state's power.  

It may be worth it to say a little more about what that last point means.

The story that's most popular on the American institutional right is that the Constitution intended for Congress to make federal laws and that much administrative rulemaking is therefore an invasion of Congress's power by overeager federal bureacrats. The problem is that many of the people who believe in this story also believe that the reason the administrative state has gained this improper power is that courts have not been sufficiently aggressive in policing the boundary between Congressional and administrative power. If only courts would stop the administrative state from operating in zones that the Constitution empowers Congress to govern, these conservatives think, then the administrative state's power could be limited.

The problem I have with this view is that there are lots of states that have already have all of the formal legal arrangements that conservatives want courts to affirm already baked into their constitutions, and these states have administrative states that are just as powerful. Take the United Kingdom as an example. There is absolutely no ambiguity in the British constitution that Parliament has supreme power over all things in the country. If that's right, then why do we see powerful administrative agencies in the UK making just as many rules as ones in the United States do?

I suspect the answer is something like this: any advanced economy generates its wealth through capitalism, and capitalism moves fast. Legislative bodies, on the other hand, are slow. They require lots of time for debate, analysis, and political maneuvering before they can arrive at a decision. Furthermore, the public character of their proceedings increases the costs of making certain kinds of decisions by subjecting each stage of their reasonoing to the exacting scrutiny of the nosy democratic public. Because of this basic asymmetry between the rates of change in advanced capitalist and the slow pace of legislative bodies, a different kind of institution, one more able to arrive at quick and decisive decisions, is needed to effectively oversee advanced economies. 

Carl Schmitt, [writing](https://archive.org/details/crisisofparliame0000schm_b6i4/page/49/mode/1up) almost a hundred years ago, makes this point better than  I could ever hope to:

> Great political and economic decisions on which the fate of mankind rests no longer result today (if they ever did) from balancing opinions in public debate and counterdebate. Such decisions are no longer the outcome of parliamentary debate...As things stand today, it is of course *practically impossible* [my emphasis] not to work with commitees, and increasingly smaller committees; in this way the parliamentary plenum gradually drifts away from its purpose (that is, from its public), and as a result becomes a mere faÃ§ade.
>
> Small and exclusive commmittees of parties or of party coalitions make their decisions behind closed doors, and what representatives of big capitalist interest groups aree to in the smallest committees is more important for the fate of millions of people, perhaps, than any political decisions. The idea of modern parliamentarism, the demand for checks, and the belief in openness and publicity were born in the struggle against the secret politics of absolute princes. The popular sense of freedom and justice was outraged by arcane practices that decided the fate of nations in secret resolutions. But how harmless and idyllic are the objects of cabinet politics in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries compared with the fate that is at stake today and which is the subject of all manner of secrets [my note: technocapital].
>
> In the face of this reality, the belief in a discussion public must suffer a terrible disillusionment...the samllest number still believe that just laws and the right poltiicas can be achieved through newspaper articles, speeches at demonstrations, and parliamentary debates.

We simply can't expect legislative bodies to competently oversee advanced economies because they change and move too quickly. So no matter what legal doctrines your constitution or courts espouse, it is inevitable that the an administrative state will rise to power in order to handle the contingencies of capitalism. Courts can police administrative power at the margins and in individual controversial cases, but they can never transfer power back to legislative bodies. That's because those bodies are innately unable to discharge the responsibilities of advanced economic policymaking. This is a proposition supported by the governance history of every advanced economy on earth.  

If you don't like the way the administrative state in the United States currently operates, and I certainly am not its biggest fan, then you either have to make due without advanced capitalism or propose a mechanism that can oversee advanced capitalism with equal or greater competency. Congress is not a serious candidate for such a mechanism, so in the end all we are talking about is alternative forms of the administrative state. I hope conservatives who have valid concerns about the administrative state will take this lesson seriously and stop putting energy into legal changes that in no way influence the historical forces that are actually responsible for the administrative state's power. 

All of the above are quite bold theoretical speculations that may not be fully supported by my results. But even if I'm wrong about all that, I think the results are at least interesting in that they show that the consensus among intelligent and well-informed investors was that *Loper Bright* didn't change anything about how businesses are regulated in the United States in a way that would make them decisively better or worse off. Given the extremely enthusiastic and apocalyptic reception of the decision on both sides of the admin state debate, both sides could stand to reevaluate how they understand the decision. Whatever else it did, it does not appear to have affected the American economy in any significant way.
