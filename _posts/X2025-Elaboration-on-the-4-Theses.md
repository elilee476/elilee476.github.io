# Elaboration on the Four Critical Theses on the Law

Several weeks ago I [posted](https://elilee476.github.io/2024/11/08/Four-Critical-Theses-on-the-Law.html) a list of four "critical theses" on the law. I promised to add more later, and that's what I am doing in this post.

There was an entire school of legal theory in the late 20th century called "Critical Legal Studies" about which much has been [said](https://www.yalelawjournal.org/essay/reconstructing-critical-legal-studies). There is also now a rising school on the right called Common Good Constitutionalism which has been compared to CLS in the sense that it similarly disregards fixed legal constraints in favor of moralizing and outcome-driven judging. 

I'm not committed to any particular form of analogy existing between CLS and Common Good Constitutionalism, but I do think it's worth trying to describe the disillusioned attitude about law's capacity to transcend politics that animates both tendencies. Supporters of both have tended to avoid mainstream Anglo jurisprudential ways of presenting their ideas in favor of more historical approaches that depict past thinkers' constructions of legal theories. In doing so, they often talk past many of their critics who refuse to take anyone's ideas seriously unless they are presented in clear theoretical and logical terms. 

I hope to take a step towards alleviating this miscommunication by giving the case for a set of precise theoretical theses here. I will restate each thesis in the header of the following sections and then attempt to describe what it means and give arguments in favor of it. In prosecuting that objective, I will frequently, if not always, draw on the thinking of Carl Schmitt. 

## The rules can't tell you how to follow the rules

Put more specifically in the legal context: the law cannot be derived from the content of legal rules.

My arguments here will be primarily in response to Professor Larry Solum's discssusion of Wittgenstein-inspired rule skepticism in a [law review article](https://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2958&context=facpub) on indeterminacy. I will try to give a fair presentation of what I understand as Solum's attempt at refuting this thesis and then provide two interrelated objections, the outcome of which I take to validate the thesis. 

We'll start with Solum's version of the thesis:

> As I understand it, the critical version of rule-skepticism is the argument that one can always come up with a perfectly plausible interpretation of any rule, including legal rules, such that any particular behavior can be seen as either following or not following the rule. The claim is that as far as the rules are concerned, "Anything goes!"

Solum's passage is attempting to describe a general philosophical problem about which there exists an [entire literature](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rule-following/). The idea is basically that whatever conduct any rule appears to demand, it is possible to argue in a concrete case that the previously-interpeted meaning of the rule does not extend to that case. Just because all of our physical observations conform to the rule that E=MC^2, there may be some zone in the universe where E=MC^3. 

In the law, a plausible version of this would be the interpretation of a state speeding statute that says nothing more than that a vehicle may not travel more than 65 MPH on the freeway. If an ambitious DA tried to prosecute a local ambulance driver for driving at 70 MPH to rescue a dying patient, then everyone would want to say that even if the rule applies to all previous defendents prosecuted for speeding, there is an exception in this case. This might seem universally reasonable, but hopefully the reader see that once the possibility of such exceptions is conceded, skeptical attacks can be raised against the application of a legal rule to any concrete case.

Solum's first approach against the rule-skeptic proceeds by conceding that rules like traffic codes are *theoretically* vulnerable to rule-skeptical attack but in practice meaningless. This means that while it logically possible that the content of the rule can allow for any outcome due to interpretive ambiguity about what its terms mean, in actual legal practice this ambiguity does not prevent courts from issuing tickets for running red lights. 

Another way of expressing Solum's argument is with the classic law review phrase that rule-skepticism "proves too much." Because rule-skepticism destroys the posssibility of *any* rule-following behavior, it holds no more danger for the lawyer than it does for a chess-player. Playing chess according to the rules is clearly possible, even though skeptical attacks can in theory be succesfully raised against any claim to be following the rules of chess, so (Solum thinks) an identical conclusion can be drawn about legal practice. Rule-skepticism is thus banished to the philosophy classroom and holds no "practical bite."

Why is it possible to play chess or practice law even though an overabstract philosopher can make skeptical attacks about the interpretation of the rules? In both cases, following Kripke's "solution" to Wittgensteinian rule-skepticism, Solum believe it is because there is a background of community agreement on how to interpret the rules. The rules themselves may not contain sufficient resources to head off skeptical attacks, but because legal practice takes place in actual communities, what the community *thinks* about how rules should be interpreted can be used to answer a skeptic who postulates interpretive attacks against any interpretation of a rule. 

At this stage, we can summarize Solum's argument in three stages:
1. General rule-skepticism, and therefore legal rule-skepticism, is indefeasaible.
2. But because of its universally destructive treatment of all rules (even utterly uncontroversial ones like the rules of checkers), rule-skepticism has no practical consequences.
3. Community agreement can supply the additional interpretive content that the rule-skeptic demands.

I obviously agree with the first step, but I think (2) is wrong, and (3) is just another way of saying exactly what my thesis claims: the outcomes demanded by the rules cannot be deduced from the content of the rules themselves. 

Starting with (2), it is obvious that the law's interpretive ambiguity *does* have bite in *some* cases. Much constitutional litigation is nothing more than a dispute over what terms like "due process" or "cruel" and "unusual" mean. Solum is aware of this, but he thinks that the fact that this is only universally recognized true for some cases means that the law is not completely indeterminate, merely sometimes underdetermined. In general, throughout his article, Solum is often satisfied with proving that indeterminacy or underdeterminacy can be cabined to hard cases, rendering the rest of the law perfectly determinate and clear.

I think that's a pretty glib way of dismissing the issue of indeterminacy, but that's an issue for another time.[^1] All I will say for now is that nobody would call Stalinism a law-bound governance system just because some of its rules, like traffic violations, have relatively determinate applications. What I mean by that is that proving that merely some cases of determinacy exist does not go very far in answering the actual concern that CLS has with the legal system: that it frequently (perhaps not 100% of the time) serves as a de-facto-arbitary but seemingly-legitimate justification for domination. The fact that legal rules have interpretive ambiguity is something that's quite consequential for our legal system, so Wittengensteinian rule-skepticism is a completely practical concern for any engaged citizen.[^2] 

The bigger problem with Solum's move is that determinacy *as such* is not the same thing as determinacy arising exclusively from the content of rules. Just because I can predict how a rule will be interpreted and applied does not mean that the rule itself is exclusively responsible for that determinacy. Again, Solum, who is a careful and thorough reasoner, is perfectly aware of this. He admits that in order to succeed in showing that rules can be determinate in some cases, he must make recourse to content that lies outside of what is strictly contained within the rules themselves. 

That move is perfectly acceptable if one's argumentative objective is just to prove that the law as a system has some durable core of determinacy. But my thesis never denies that--it simply claims that such determinacy, if it exists, can never be derived from the rules alone. Law can be  determinate (show trials are perfectly determinate), but that doesn't mean that the *form of legal rules* is responsible for this determinacy. Instead, how the community chooses to use legal rules is what really allows them to have determinate applications. 

"How the community chooses to use legal rules" sounds benign and uncontroversial--maybe all we mean here is that judges should apply accepted canons of statutory interpretations. Solum supports a conclusion like this when he sums up the "bite" of this realization as nothing more than the unrealistic possibility that a community's linguistic practice will completely change at once. But the way a community chooses to use (and not use) legal rules holds more practical significance than what is implied by dismissing as unrealistic sudden and rapid changes in intepretive practices. If a "critical" lawyer can show that legal rules are frequently used to justify maintaining existing social arrangements, then we have seen something important about legal rules. Solum is right that such critics owe an actual empirical justification of this view, but this justification becomes much more plausible if one can admit that it is how communities choose to use legal rules (rather than the mere content of those rules themselves) that decides the case.

## Sovereignty is always conserved

A maxim that many legal formalists use to characterize our political system is "rule by law not by men." I'll try my best to summarize what kind of political arrangements are envisioned by this phrase, and then I will develop my second thesis in the form of a denial that such an ideal could ever be achieved. 

An immediate difficulty regarding the maxim is that laws are made by men. Therefore, if laws rule, then we are merely talking about the men who made the laws ruling instead of some other group of men. But that's not exactly fair to our formalist friends. They are perfectly aware that laws are made by men, so, when they use the maxim, they must mean something besides the complete absence of human agency in political arrangements. 

A more plausible reading of the phrase would therefore be that the arrangements previous men enacted are controlling rather than the decisions of currently-existing political actors. 

## No hard distinction between rulemaking and adjudication



## A preference for clear and open exercises of power over mystification



## How should judges decide cases?

In all honesty, I don't know (or really care--it's all epiphenemonal bro) how judges should decide cases. I am confident that judges care even less what my github blog has to say about how they should decide cases. However, to preempt any objections that I've provided nothing constructive with my theses, I'll briefly discuss what I understand to be their practical consequences for legal practice.

One outcome of the accepting the theses is that if 1) the text of legal rules does not in fact decide for us what the result of a case should be, 2) the law does not and cannnot render legal coercion anything other than a concrete person's decision, and 3) does not allow us to pass blame for legal outcomes onto the writers of rules as a class distinct from rule-appliers, then no judge's claim to have their "hands tied" by the nature of a legal rule should be accepted. 

We often see claims like this when judges calling themselves "textualists" or "originalists" arrive at absurd and/or unjust outcomes while claiming that they had no choice but to reach said outcome because the legal rule applicable to the case demanded it. A great example of this behavior can be seen in Justice Scalia's insane dissent in *[Ransom v. FIA Card Services](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2010/09-907)*.

*Ransom* was a case about what kinds of expenses the bankruptcy code allows debtors to include in calculations of their disposable income available for repayment to creditors. The code says that in calculating the costs of financing a vehicle, the court should consult an "applicable" IRS table that includes a schedule of how much different kinds of vehicles cost to finance. The debtor in the case tried to claim financing costs an as expense even though he owned the vehicle outright. All of the justices agreed this was obvious nonsense, but Scalia's dissent argued that the statute drafters simply erred by instructing courts to consult the table without including an express exception for debtors who owned their vehicles outright.

Scalia was upset that the code didn't use the phrase "if applicable" and instead went with the mere "applicable." In justifying the absurd result that debtors can claim financing expenses for assets which they did not finance, Scalia is satisfied to just blaim Congress for not writing the law correctly. But if one takes my critical theses into account, then no such move is possible.

That is because the phrase "applicable" does not mean *anything* apart from how courts choose to interpret it. It's therefore impossible to claim the meaning of the words constrains courts; in fact the exact opposite is true! As a result, Scalia cannot claim that Congress is responsible for this outcome. It was his choice to interpret the term in that way. There was nothing Congress did or wrote that can logically demand Scalia's result. He is fully responsible for the stupidity of his decision. 

I know: that still doesn't sound very constructive. The optimistic way of putting this would be that judges face a more difficult problem than simply applying fixed defintions of words to novel fact patterns. Instead, judges are always co-creating the meaning of the rules they interpret when they apply them in specific cases. That is not a license to ignore what the law says--there can still bettter be worse ways of interpreting law. 


[^1]: I don't want to sound too negative about Solum, whom I very much appreciate as an interlocutor against the critical views about the law that I am trying to capture with my theses. However, I would encourage Solum and those sympathetic to his approach to be more charitable in their readings of thinkers who do not write within the analytical jurisprudence tradition. In his article, when discussing the issue of the law's underdeterminacy (as opposed to complete indeterminacy), Solum ultimately rejects any theories of pervasive underdeterminacy because no clear criteria have been put forth by scholars for what counts as "pervasisve" enough to characterize the law as ridden with undeterminacy. I think Solum's demand for perfectly-delineated and exhaustive (the standards of analytical jurisprudence) criteria for "important cases" amounts to asking that other thinkers express their ideas in exactly the terms with which one is familiar, which is intellectual provincialism. 

[^2]: There is a facially absurd line in the Solum piece: "these versions of indeterminacy will seldom, if ever, make a practical difference to the parties to a dispute." The fact that the first amendment consists of ridiculously vague nonsense absolutely makes a practical difference to all Americans. The communications platforms on which the vast majority of Americans obtain information about the world banned stating the truthful claim that receiving the Covid vaccine will not prevent someone from contracting the virus. This ban was in place during the period when public debate about vaccine mandates was relevant to the formation of public policy. In creating a first amendment protection for monopolistic communications platforms' power to limit the views that can be expressed on them, the court leveraged open-ended language to functionally prevent most Americans from expressing or hearing truthful and important claims about the world. It is therefore absurd to claim that the law's areas of underdeterminacy do not make a practical difference.
