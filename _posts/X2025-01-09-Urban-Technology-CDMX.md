> Area only for women and children

I would expect (please let me know if I'm wrong!) that most fair-minded readers could agree with the following two propositions regarding this image:

- Having an institution like this to protect women and children using public transportation would be better than the current status quo in American cities.
- It is unfortunate to have to resort to such an institution in order to protect women and children.

Since I think most readers will agree with these statements, I'll spend the remainder of the post discussing corrolaries that I believe follow from them.

## An attack on NEOLIBERAL Venture Capitalists 

There has been a deterioration of safe living conditions in the United States' urban areas:

> According to the NCVS, the urban violent-crime rate increased 40% from 2019 to 2023. Excluding simple assault, the urban violent-crime rate rose 54% over that span. From 2022 to 2023, the urban violent-crime rate didn’t change to a statistically significant degree, so these higher crime rates appear to be the new norm in America’s cities.
>
> The urban property-crime rate is also getting worse. It rose from 176.1 victimizations per 1,000 households in 2022 to 192.3 in 2023. That’s part of a 26% increase in the urban property-crime rate since 2019. These numbers exclude rampant shoplifting, since the NCVS is a survey of households and not of businesses.

A promiment response to this trend has been proposals from technologists to sidestep participation in municipal governance and instead create technology products that allow their users to avoid the trends described in the previous quote and image.

One example of this is the startup [Via](https://ridewithvia.com/), which seeks to recreate public transportation but with access limited to vetted, paying customers. Another example is the app [Citizen](https://citizen.com/), which allows users to avoid avoid areas of high-crime-occurence by providing them with live data on where and when crimes are taking place. Others believe that generative AI (a tool for creating written, visual, or auditory content) will somehow improve urban living conditions, though I'm not aware of any concrete proposals for how this would be accomplished.

It's perfectly fine for companies to attempt to sell these products to users who are willing to pay for them. But I think the focus among technologists on this species of solution has led to some intellectual errors. 

First, while some users may find it worth it to pay for these products, we ought not to conclude that lining VC's pockets is the only way to make effective, scalable improvements in urban living conditions. Policies like the one depicted in the post's opening photo could be easily accompolished by municipal transit agencies without any need to impose the additional costs and access-limitations on transit-users assosiciated with providing a margin of profit for private investors. In other words, if we think that a good solution to declining urban safety is to create spaces for the vulnerable to receive extra protection from violence, then it would be wasteful to implement these solutions using private sector methods that inherently tend to limit access to their products to the affluent. 

A related error is technologists' overestimation of the benefits of using privatization as a tool for escaping deteriorating living conditions. Many of these technologists argue that because it is possible (using technology products from which they profit) to create private spaces where the affluent can be protected from these trends, they are not as worth emphasizing as some elements of the right-populist coalition believe they are. A particularly noxious form of this view can be seen when technologists use the phrase "skill-issue" to dismiss Americans' complaints about worsening living conditions. Their implication is that if you cannot scam your way into an income high enough to avoid these trends, then you do not deserve access to the safety and transportation goods which your tax dollars supposedly fund.  

The bottom line is that if you think that privatization can protect you from your country turning into an inegalitarian, violent mess; then you misunderstand what actual inegalitarian and violent societies are like. In such societies, exposure to violence and expropriation is never distributed equally across all social classes. Poorly-administed societies that have high levels of violence and property crime almost always have privatized and protected spaces for the wealthy. 

Take Haiti as an example. Even while Haiti's literal government collapsed and the country was ruled by warring gangs, affluent oligarchs living in the hills continued to have access to power, running water, sanitation, and--most importantly--security. That was because these citizens had already completely freed themselves from any dependence on the state to provide these goods and instead obtained those goods almost exclusively through private arrangements. 

My point here is not to judge whether it's better or worse to have privatized oases within a state that has low levels of order. I instead want the reader to understand that privatization ***cannot*** function as an escape from increasing violence and disorder in one's society. The condition of a poor and violent society *simply is one in which public goods like safety and health are provisioned privately*. You are therefore conceding decline into third-world conditions if you think that privatization is the right response to the failure of our state to provide public goods. The correct characterization of those conditions is not and never has been the complete absence of goods like security and health; it is rather exactly the scenario in which those goods are provided privately rather than by the state. 

There are many reasons to think privatizing public goods is an inadequate and cowardly response to the conditions described at the beginning of this section:

1. It is simply evil to deprive the vast majority of one's fellow citizens of the conditions one regards as necessary for basic digntiy in one's own life.
2. It's much more wasteful to provision goods like security privately rather than publicly. Think about the costs of hiring 20 police officers to protect a neighborhood of 1,000 people vs each household hiring a private security guard.
3. Extreme competition for scarce and expensive privately-provided public goods ruins elite culture. A politician or executive in the United States or Germany could lose their job due to poor performance and still expect running water, healthcare, and a safe living environment. In societies where the only way to obtain these goods is to be wealthy enough to purchase them privately, people in positions of power will be more motivated to insulate themselves and their descendants from any competition that could prevent them from being in the select group that can afford such goods. This leads to high levels of corruption and anti-meritocratic employment practices because human beings usually aren't willing to tolerate the risk of falling into conditions of extreme poverty and violence. 

The creation of competent states that could ensure basic levels of welfare and security for all their citizens was an incredible achievement of modernity. We ought not to tolerate the destruction of this achievement, especially if we are expecting to depend on privatization to lighten the impact of such destruction. 

## Straussian Moment

I apologize for being circumspect because I'm writing under my own name.  

I was once at an event hosted by an organization that began its life as an effort to translate right-populist political energy into serious reforms backed by capable elites. When people at this event were asked to go around in a circle and say what they thought the most important political issue in the country was, I responded by saying immigration. Everyone in the circle laughed at this idea.

I have to concede that my general behavior at this event was perhaps not fully compliant with the social expectations of high-bureaucrat gatherings, but I still think this response was illuminating.

It is sometimes desirable to pursue policy solutions like the one in this post's opening image. Focusing on practical and achievable objectives is probably a better route for both career advancement and immediate impact than attempting to address the underlying reasons why urban living conditions have deteriorated so dramatically in past years. While I can concede it is healthy for politically-involved young professionals to use the decision criteria of practicality and feasability for selecting which policy proposals to promote, the decision to focus on easily-implementable solutions should not cause us to forget the missteps that created the problem in the first place.

Anyone who was involved in creating a situation in which American cities would be better off with women-and-children only subway cars should not hold any influential place in public life beyond writing mournful "how could we go so wrong" retrospectives. While it may be quixotic to attempt to revive the social order in which there was no need for such policies, it does **not** follow that it is equally pointless to disempower those who were responsible for the negative changes.

It would be an enormous mispricing of reputational costs if such people did not face professional consquences for the policies they chose to support. Those who want to create a rational discursive environment for the formation of public policy should favor imposing costs for promoting harmful policies. These costs ought to be commensurate with the harms that those policies have created. 

The destruction of public spaces safe for women is an enormous harm. Nobody who supported the choices that led to it, or who at any point stood in the way of political forces trying to prevent this outcome, is fit to be taken seriously in discsussions of governance or policy (at least not until they profusely apologize). The political actors who made or supported these choices are not "adults in the room" or "elites" whose approval populists need to court in order to govern effectively, they are total idiots whose incompetence and cowardice made life worse for millions of their fellow citizens. They deserve no place in our public life.
