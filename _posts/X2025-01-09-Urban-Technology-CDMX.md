I would expect (please let me know if I'm wrong!) that most fair-minded readers could agree with the following two propositions regarding this image:

- Having an institution like this to protect women and children using public transportation would be better than the current status quo in American cities.
- It is unfortunate to have to resort to such an institution in order to protect women and children.

Since I think most readers will agree with these statements, I'll spend the remainder of the post discussing two corrolaries that I believe follow from them.

## An attack on NEOLIBERAL Venture Capitalists 

There has been a deterioration of safe living conditions in the United States' urban areas:

> According to the NCVS, the urban violent-crime rate increased 40% from 2019 to 2023. Excluding simple assault, the urban violent-crime rate rose 54% over that span. From 2022 to 2023, the urban violent-crime rate didn’t change to a statistically significant degree, so these higher crime rates appear to be the new norm in America’s cities.
>
> The urban property-crime rate is also getting worse. It rose from 176.1 victimizations per 1,000 households in 2022 to 192.3 in 2023. That’s part of a 26% increase in the urban property-crime rate since 2019. These numbers exclude rampant shoplifting, since the NCVS is a survey of households and not of businesses.

One response to this trend has been proposals from technologists to sidestep participation in municipal governance and instead create technology products that allow their users to avoid the trends described in the previous quote and image.

One example of this is the startup [Via](https://ridewithvia.com/), which seeks to recreate public transportation but with access limited to vetted, paying customers. Another example is the app [Citizen](https://citizen.com/), which allows users to avoid avoid areas of high-crime-occurence by providing them with live data on where and which crimes are taking place. Others believe that generative AI (a tool for creating written or visual content) will somehow improve urban living conditions, though I'm not aware of any concrete proposals for how this would be accomplished.

It's perfectly fine for companies to attempt to sell these products to users who are willing to pay for them. But I think 

## Straussian Moment

I was once at an event hosted by an institution that began its life as an effort to translate populist political energy into serious reforms backed by capable elites. When someone at this event asked me what I thought the most important political issue in the country was, I responded by saying immigration. Everyone within earshot laughed at this idea.

I have to concede that my general behavior at this event was perhaps not fully compliant with the social expectations of elite bureaucrat gatherings, but I still think this response was dispositive.

It is possible to focus on policy solutions like the one in the photo in order to improve life in American cities. Doing so is probably a better route for both career advancement and immediate impact than attempting to address the underlying reasons why urban living conditions have deteriorated so dramatically in past years. While I can concede it is healthy for politically-involved young professionals to use the decision criteria in the previous sentence to select which policy proposals to pursue, the demand to focus on practical and easily-implementable solutions can also obscure certain important phenomena.

I believed that anyone who was involved in creating the situation in which American cities need a women-and-children only subway
