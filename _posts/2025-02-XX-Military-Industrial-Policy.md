# Some scattered thoughts on the national security justification for industrial policy

The United States Department of Defense is both the largest employer and the government agency with the largest budget in the entire world. As the regulatory and business outlook for software companies' traditional lines of business (consumer advertising, consumer advertising, and consumer advertising) becomes [less compelling](https://www.google.com/search?q=bigtech+stock+down&oq=bigtech+stock+down&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIICAEQABgWGB4yCAgCEAAYFhgeMg0IAxAAGIYDGIAEGIoFMg0IBBAAGIYDGIAEGIoFMg0IBRAAGIYDGIAEGIoFMgoIBhAAGIAEGKIEMgoIBxAAGIAEGKIEMgoICBAAGIAEGKIE0gEIMjUwNGowajmoAgCwAgE&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) as a source of continued growth, it is reasonable for the tech industry to look toward military contracting as a new economic opportunity.

I am concerned about some of the public discourse that has been put promoted by tech companies pursuing the strategy I described in the previous paragraph. I'm merely a slightly-right-of-center moderate, so I of course have no problem with corporations discharging their responsibility to their shareholders in whatever legally-compliant way they see fit. However, I would also want the fine readers of my blog to be equipped to identify the weak thinking associated with the burgenoning "defense-tech" and "industrial policy" spaces. It is in that spirit that I would like to discuss several concerns I have with the arguments put forth by tech companies and their lobbyists on why they should be cut into our government's massive defense spending.

*Eisenhower's response to the USSR's achievement of conventional military superiority in Western Europe*

Since the 2016 election and Washington's conversion to universal hawkishness on China, there have been calls from across the political spectrum to address the United States' lack of industrial capacity to engage in extended war. As far as I can tell, the idea here is basically that the United States has lost the ability to physically make a lot of the components necessary for producing enough materiel to replace stocks destroyed by extended combat with the PLA.

I find the idea that we would ever want to engage in extended all-out conflict with the PLA, and a fortiori that we should order our economy to be able to do this, absolutely *deranged*. Some people say we have to this in order to defend one-party states like Japan and Vietnam from illiberal Chinese agression, while others would concede that although all-out conventional war with the PLA is a terrible idea, we have to be ready for anything.

I agree that we should be ready to defend ourselves and our interests in case the PRC decides to threaten either, but that doesn't mean we have to either engage in extended conventional warfare with the PLA or have an industrial base capable of supporting such warfare. More importantly, I believe this conclusion holds no matter how much you believe China is an aggressive expansionist power bent on destroying the international world order. 

Allow me to illustrate my view with a case from 20th century history. When President Dwight D. Eisenhower took office, everyone agreed that the Soviet Union possessed conventional military superiority in Europe. In plain English, that meant that if the Soviets decided to launch a ground invasion of Europe, the United States government believed they would certainly win.
