# A Discussion of Wasteful Plaintiff-side Litigation and Proposal for Reform

The United States is an extremely litigious society. Apart from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Legal Reform Institute--there's sadly actually not that much empirical research on just *how* much this screws up the economy. But the Swiss insurance firm Swiss Re, which doesn't have as much of a clear bias, describes this as [follows](https://www.swissre.com/press-release/Litigation-costs-drive-US-liability-claims-by-57-over-past-decade-reveals-Swiss-Re-Institute/0b538159-9648-47da-a152-4550a7640d35):

> Litigation costs are rising and are now the key driver of liability claims...we observe continuous increases in aggressive litigation practices...Increased claims costs not only create a riskier and more costly environment for businesses but are also a concern for insurers. Over the past five years, US commercial casualty insurance losses grew at an average annual rate of 11% to USD 143 billion in 2023 [my note: many times more than the rate of GDP growth]

An insurer's objective is merely to arrive at a correct actuarial understanding of firms' litigation risks, not to publicly advocate for reducing them. We can therefore take this account somewhat seriously as an accurate summation of just how unusually expensive it is for American businesses to face such massive liability claims.

Swiss Re believes--and I think this is simple common sense--that there are unique elements of the American legal system that explain why this is happening:

>It is driven by a range of socioeconomic, legislative and litigation trends such as an increased tendency to settle compensation claims in court and is most pronounced in the US, where tort law is based on precedent and court cases are adjudicated by juries. In addition, third-party litigation funding (TPLF) – the process by which litigants and law firms can fund their litigation with the help of a third-party investor – facilitates access to trial, and the legal system allows for the payment of large sums of compensation, particularly for bodily injury claims. In 2023 alone, there were 27 court cases awarding compensation of more than USD 100 million each.

What Swiss Re is alluding to here is the rise and increased scale of a well-funded plaintiff-side litigation industry. [Superstar plaintiff's lawyers](https://www.event.law.com/nationallawjournal-etl/2024-honorees) frequently earn 10-figure payouts upon successful jury verdicts in their trials. Some plaintiff's attorneys even earn [billions](https://www.nola.com/news/crime_police/bp-oil-spill-plaintiffs-attorneys-justify-600-million-in-fees-expenses/article_f7adb010-82a8-5dd0-9bdb-8834f2b12767.html#:~:text=The%20$555%20million%20fee%20award%20requested%20comes,economic%20and%20medical%20payouts%2C%20the%20filing%20says.) from mere settlements. One can assume that the litigation finance firms that invest in this space also earn large returns from these outcomes.

These large payouts are caused by a fee arrangement known as contingency. When a lawyer accepts a case "on contingency," the clients are charged nothing, but if the case results in a settlement or damages verdict, then the lawyer receives a portion of the payout. Since many law firms which represent plaintiffs are financed primarily or exclusively by contingency deals, they often enter into arrangements with litigation financiers who fund the firm's operations in exchange for a portion of their contigency winnings.

On first inspection, one might think there is nothing pernicious about contigency arrangements. Investors--whether attorneys (who are effectively acting as investors when they choose to accept fees this way) or litigation finance firms--seem incentivized to accept good cases and reject bad ones because their compensation depends on the success of the cases they undertake. Contingency also has the attractive property of aligning the economics of the client and the lawyer (our law and econ friends would refer to this reducing agency costs) so that the lawyer is incentivized to win through direct financial exposure to the benefits of victory rather than mere reputational benefits. 

## An Illustration from Corporate Law 

Contingency resembles the concept of equity investment. Equity investors in a firm receive a share of the upside if the firm performs well and lose their investment if the firm fails. We can think of this as holding a call option on the firm's cashflows. Below a certain level of return, the investor has a capped downside equal to the cost of their investment; above that level, the investor's upside is uncapped. Since this call-option structure of equity investment constitutes a fundamental and extremely common way that firms raise capital, what could be wrong with law firms doing the same? 

Though equity investor-ownership is ubiquitous in the American economy, there is actually a big problem with this return structure:

![Long-Call](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3aabea1a-bfde-4243-81fe-afbc004975ca)

Notice the portion of the upward-sloping line that is below the x axis. Using the analogy of a call option, this represents the set of possibilities in which the firm earns some cashflows but not enough for the investors to make a positive return. These possibilites exist because most firms are financed by a combination of equity and debt. In plain English, this means that firms fund themselves in part by selling stock and in part by borrowing money which requires them to pay back fixed amounts. Since bankruptcy [law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/507) requires that debt is  *always* (ok, almost always) repaid before equity investors receive anything, it is possible for the firm to earn positive cashflows without having equity investors receive any. That would be because there is just enough cash to pay or partially pay the firm's debt obligations.

If a firm is earning enough to pay its creditors but does not have enough left over to give its equity owners any return, then the fact that equity owners typically manage the firm becomes a problem. In the Delaware Chancery case of [Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland v. Pathe Comm ](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/20070606%20Credit%20Lyonnais.pdf), the famous Chancellor Allen remarks in a footnote:

> The possibility of insolvency can do curious things to incentives, exposing creditors to risks of opportunistic behavior and creating complexities for directors...[correct results] will not be reached by a director who thinks he
owes duties directly to shareholders only.

What Chancellor Allen is getting at here is that in the situation described before the quote, equity owner-managers do not have the proper incentives for managing the firm. Insofar as they are self-interested, they are incentivized to either do nothing or take excessive risk because they receive no benefits from the firm increasing its cashflows as long as they remain below the level of the firm's total debt obligations. They don't care about what happens to creditors because they are not going to get paid anyways, so they have no reason to invest in managing the firm well.

The bankruptcy code explicitly addresses this problem by creating new duties for the managers of a corporation when the corporation is in a state of insolvency. That means that when the firm is not earning enough to fully repay its debt, the bankruptcy code creates a law requirement for managers to pursue the best interests of the creditors. Outside of insolvency, equity owners face no such requirements because they are already motivated by their return structure to act in the best interests of creditors. But once they lose this incentive, the law sees the need to explicitly require them to do this.

# The Lesson for Plaintiff's Litigation

As we saw in the above discussion of insolvency, equity owners can have bad incentives (agency costs) that require affirmative correction by law. These agency costs arise from the call-option structure of equity returns in which the investor's downside is capped at the cost of their investment while their upside is uncapped. 

I hope the reader can already see that contingency arrangements have the exact same call-option return structure. The point I hope to make is that this return structure creates analogous bad incentives for lawyers taking cases on contingency or financiers investing in such litigations. 

**The problem is simple: contigency causes lawyer-investors to ignore the costs of litigating claims when the payout of those claims is below the threshold at which they get paid, just as ordinary equity investors are incentivized to ignore managing a firm when its cashflows are below the firm's debt burden.**

There is an obvious difficulty in this comparison: in most contigency deals, lawyers receive a pro rata share of every positive settlement, so there does not appear to be any situation in which there is not enough prospective return for the investor to receive anything. But there is in fact just such a situation when one consideres the *total* costs of the litigation, not just the costs to the financiers of plaintiffs' claims.

The two big costs that fall into this category are the legal fees paid by the defendent and the burden placed on the court system when parties engage in extensive litigation. We can think of the total benefits of plaintiff-side litigation as:

payouts distributed to deserving plaintiffs minus contigency share distributed to plaintiffs' lawyers minus the previously mentioned two cost categories associated with the litigation process

If you buy this as a basic model for thinking about plaintiffs' claims, then we can see how there are situations in which contigency investors face bad incentives. If a litigation has a small expected value for contingency investors but creates much larger costs for courts and defendants, then the contigency investors are incentivized to pursue a claim that has a clearly negative value. 

This isn't just a hypothetical and unrealistic possibility. A great example would be securities derivative claims. There is an entire industry of securities plaintiffs' lawyers who have a lot of experience bringing claims and can very quickly and easily file one. If they believe there is even a small chance of one of these claims being succesful and getting a big payout, then they won't mind quickly and easily filing a claim. Even if these claims create costs far in excess of their likelihood of success, the contingency investor doesn't care because they are not financially exposed to these costs.

# Professional ethics counterargument to my story

There is a big problem someone could have with the story I've just told: the adversarial role of the American lawyer. Who cares if plaintiff's lawyers aren't incentivized to care about the total costs of their claims? Isn't their role just to zealously represent the interests of their client, with the legal system taking care of deciding who is right or wrong? 

The response to this is that it's absolutely right that lawyers need only care about the interests of their clients. But the problem with contigency is that conflates the role of lawyer and investor. The foundation of profit-seeking investment as an efficient way of allocating resources is that the investor is incentivized to puruse value-creative activities because they share in the upsides and downsides of the investment. If a lawyer wants to merely represent clients, then they need not incur any duties other than professional ethics to care about whether their representation creates or substracts value from society. But if a lawyer wants to *also* be an investor, then that role only makes sense if their incentives are properly aligned with value creation. That means it becomes a problem if they are not properly incentivized to create economic value. The rewards of investorship only make sense if those incentives are in place.

# Constructive Policy Solutions

I don't want to just complain about this problem, so I'm going to propose a policy solution that can remedy this misalignment of incentives. The idea is to expose contingency investors to the full spectrum of the upsides and downsides of their investment, just as a regular investor would be in a 100% equity-financed firm. 

The way to create this exposure would be to replicate the contingency investor's upside exposure in the downside case. The way to do this is simple: whatever share of the winnings a plaintiff's lawyer stands to win if the case is victorious, they should have to pay the equivalent share of the defendant's cost if the claim loses. This way the contingency investor is, as all investors should ideally be, responsible for both the benefits and the costs of the investment they undertake. 

The American legal system is generally against arrangements in which the loser of a case is responsible for legal fees. Whatever justifications for this policy exist, they are much weaker in a scenario where a lawyer is acting as an investor as well as a mere advocate. If a lawyer gets to enjoy the economic privileges of being an investor, they must also face the risks. It's precisely this lack of exposure to risk that creates the excess of litigation that can be surmised from the massive factor by which plaintiffs' awards are growing faster than GDP. 

One might say to all this: big corporations are very powerful and the kinds of individual consumers who file claims against them are relatively helpless in comparison. So why care if big corporations are paying a bit more costs than is in theory optimal--aren't they going to be fine anyways? The answer to this is that unless one assumes absurd degrees of elasticity in the markets with respect to which litigation is taking place, then at least some of the improper costs imposed by litigation will be passed onto consumers. Consumers as a whole ought not to subsidize the private jets and vacation homes of plaintiffs' lawyers filing silly cases and causing needless litigation. And since the courts are funded by taxpayers, the improperiety of plaintiff-side lawyers' inventives are even more obviously inappropriate. These arguments also apply to the fear that increasing the expected costs of financing plaintiff-side litigation will chill the pursuit of meritorious claims. 

Subjecting contingency investors to the true spectrum of economic possibilites associated with their investment is only fair.
