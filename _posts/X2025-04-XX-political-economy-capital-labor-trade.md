# The Political Economy of the Capital / Labor Trade

Vietnam is a relatively poor country with lots of young people. The United States is a wealthy country with lots of old people. If both countries have open economies, then we would expect, based on my stylized description, Vietnam to exchange labor for capital with the United States, i.e. for Vietnam to run a persistent trade surplus against the United States.

So far, so good. But what about when a country runs this trade *globally*? In this post I want to try to explain why the current administration, and actors from other parts of the political spectrum, think that there's a problem with this feature of our economy. The first thing to clarify is that the best versions of these arguments tend to focus on *political economy* rather than the straightforward measures of welfare (money) that most economists specializing in trade study. The concern is that trading capital for labor may affect the role of labor in American society in ways that disempower the former *even while it increases their economically-measured welfare*. 

The tl;dr of my take on this is that this *is* a valid concern, but the recently-announced tariffs, as well as the other prominent proposals to deal with these concerns, are not going to succesfully do what the concerned-parties want them to. That sounds very milquetoast, so I'll be more clear and say that I think most of this stuff is just a massive waste of money and/or just corruption aimed at enriching Trump or Biden's clients. 

A lot of people in both of these political coalitions have an instinct that this is the case, but they don't have the theoretical tools to explain why what's going on is bad. A big part of the problem is that the arguments typically used to defend free trade are only focused on welfare, which the capital-labor trade skeptics are not trying to maximize. In fact, most of them explicitly admit that their policies *will reduce welfare* but claim it's worth it because Americans are already wealthy and what they really need is to repair the political economy problem of disempowered labor. So I hope to make a contribution by stating arguments that share a willingness to prioritize political economy problems over welfare but nonetheless find a fatal mismatch between the policies and their objectives. 

## Infant Industries

Before getting into the labor political economy stuff, I'd like to try to briefly deal with another reason people might be skeptical of persistently exchanging assets for goods (capital for labor). A short story of the Asian tigers' succesful industrial policies could be something like this: subsidize promising industries in their infancy so that they have time to mature and become competitive on the global market.  

## Labor Economics 

Anyone who has been trained in Anglophone philosophy becomes prone to making up and then insisting upon conceptual distinctions. Sometimes this is an overintellecualized indulgence, but conceptual distinctions can also help sharpen our thinking.

My contention is that it's important to distinguish between these two theories because they have ***diametrically opposed*** consequences for labor, a category which represents the economic lifeblood of the vast majority of the American people (and therefore determines the character of American society). To come right out with it: the infant-industry theory relies on suppressing wages, whereas the redistribution theory calls for increasing them. While it may be logically possible to support industrial policy on both grounds, if one does not distinguish between the two theories, then one will be unable to form an effective industrial policy that accomplishes *either* of the aims laid out previously.

If one is trying to help an industry that is currently non-competitive but promises to become so in the future, then one wants to direct all available resources within that industry towards investment. The basic problem an infant industry faces is that it cannot produce cheaply enough to survive against global competitors. In order for that industry to survive, it must either be insulated from global competition and developed exclusively within the domestic market--or it must be subsidized such that it can afford to sell below its marginal cost. 

In both cases, payments to laborers beyond their uncompetitive marginal productivity are likely to be borne by--guess who? Other laborers. The case of insulation from foreign competition is clear: tariffs are, like any consumption tax, regressive and thus will be paid by American labor (there aren't very many poor capitalists). Subsidies are more complicated because they are paid out from tax revenue. 

Or are they? The Biden Administration's brand of industrial policy involved large expenditures on borrowed (printed) money. Since that fiscal straegy tends to create inflation, which is again regressive, laborers are once again left with the check. But perhaps we could imagine instead paying for subsidies with highly progressive taxes. 

Here allow me to make a further conceptual distinction. Let's break down the required subsidies into two components:

- the quantity necessary to make the industry competitive given capital and labor costs equivalent to their marginal productivity
- the additional quantity necessary to compensate labor at prevailing or desirable rates

The idea here would be to pay laborers *above* their marginal product but to pass these costs onto the wealthy through progressive taxation. It's not that I don't think this could work, but more so that it is merely a dressed up version of a standard tax-and-transfer redistribution proposals. 

A more concrete approach would involve looking at successful Asian tigers' industrial policy. Wage suppression was a component of all of them, which is unlikely to be an accident.[^x] Asian tigers allowed their firms to hold down wages because they were trying to make production cheaper for firms.
