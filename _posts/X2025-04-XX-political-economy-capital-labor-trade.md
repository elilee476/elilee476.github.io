# The Political Economy of the Capital / Labor Trade

Vietnam is a relatively poor country with lots of young people. The United States is a wealthy country with lots of old people. If both countries have open economies, then we would expect, based on my stylized description, Vietnam to exchange labor for capital with the United States, i.e. for Vietnam to run a persistent trade surplus against the United States.

So far, so good. But what about when a country runs this trade *globally*? In this post I want to try to explain why the current administration, and actors from other parts of the political spectrum, think that there's a problem with this feature of our economy. The first thing to clarify is that the best versions of these arguments tend to focus on *political economy* rather than the straightforward measures of welfare (money) that most economists specializing in trade study. The concern is that trading capital for labor may affect the role of labor in American society in ways that disempower the former *even while it increases their economically-measured welfare*. 

The tl;dr of my take on this is that this *is* a valid concern, but the recently-announced tariffs, as well as the other prominent proposals to deal with these concerns, are not going to succesfully do what the concerned-parties want them to. That sounds very milquetoast, so I'll be more clear and say that I think most of this stuff is just a massive waste of money and/or just corruption aimed at enriching Trump or Biden's clients. 

A lot of people in both of these political coalitions have an instinct that this is the case, but they don't have the theoretical tools to explain why what's going on is bad. A big part of the problem is that the arguments typically used to defend free trade are only focused on welfare, which the capital-labor trade skeptics are not trying to maximize. In fact, most of them explicitly admit that their policies *will reduce welfare* but claim it's worth it because Americans are already wealthy and what they really need is to repair the political economy problem of disempowered labor. So I hope to make a contribution by stating arguments that share a willingness to prioritize political economy problems over welfare but nonetheless find a fatal mismatch between the policies and their objectives. 

## Infant Industries ??

Before getting into the labor political economy stuff, I'd like to try to briefly deal with another reason people might be skeptical of persistently exchanging assets for goods (capital for labor). A short story of the Asian tigers' succesful industrial policies could be something like this: subsidize promising industries in their infancy so that they have time to mature and become competitive on the global market.  

Wage suppression was a component of all of them, which is unlikely to be an accident.[^x] Asian tigers allowed their firms to hold down wages because they were trying to make production cheaper for firms. 

## Labor Economics of Trade in Mainstream Economic Theory

Economists have long been aware that production factor abundance gaps, namely the capital / labor abundance gaps that drive our trade surprlus, can cause negative consequences for labor. Put plainly, if a capital-rich labor-poor (these are relative comparisions) state trades with a labor-rich capital-poor state, then we would expect wages in the capital-rich state to fall. Consider an illustration of the prominent [Stolper-Samuelson theorem](https://are.berkeley.edu/~fally/Courses/Econ181Lecture4c.pdf), which one can read more about as a representative example of how lots of economists think about trade, below:

Economists tend to think that the depicted wage decrease is fine because total welfare goes up. Since scarce resources get employed more productively--"the pie gets bigger." Any changes in ex ante distribution can be addressed through ex post redistribution--"more pie for everyone."

As the above tweet suggests, lots of people are cynical about this story because awarding large gains to capital-owners who are already wealthy, at the *expense* of middle-class laborers––even when the size of the capitalist gains outweighs the losses of laborers. One immediate concern one might have about this transfer is that the amount of redistribution we choose is endogenous to existing wealth distributions. In plain English, the more wealth gets concentrated in a few people's hands, the more power they have, and the better they will be able to prevent any redistribution. 

There's [some empirical support](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60342) for this being the right story to tell about the last 30 years of decreasing trade barriers:

Household incomes, *after* redistributive policies, haven't increased much for most Americans, even as the pie has gotten a lot bigger. So, you might think that redistributing gains to capital under free trade isn't very realistic because capitalists will use the additional power they acquire from additional wealth to prevent exactly that redistribution. Limiting trade may therefore look like a good way to maintain a high labor share even though it involves giving up some potential gains.

## A Materialist Account of Democracy



In both cases, payments to laborers beyond their uncompetitive marginal productivity are likely to be borne by--guess who? Other laborers. The case of insulation from foreign competition is clear: tariffs are, like any consumption tax, regressive and thus will be paid by American labor (there aren't very many poor capitalists). Subsidies are more complicated because they are paid out from tax revenue. 

Or are they? The Biden Administration's brand of industrial policy involved large expenditures on borrowed (printed) money. Since that fiscal straegy tends to create inflation, which is again regressive, laborers are once again left with the check. But perhaps we could imagine instead paying for subsidies with highly progressive taxes. 

Here allow me to make a conceptual distinction. Let's break down the required subsidies into two components:

- the quantity necessary to make the industry competitive given capital and labor costs equivalent to their marginal productivity
- the additional quantity necessary to compensate labor at prevailing or desirable rates

The idea here would be to pay laborers *above* their marginal product but to pass these costs onto the wealthy through progressive taxation. It's not that I don't think this could work, but more so that it is merely a dressed up version of a standard tax-and-transfer redistribution proposals. 


## Constructive Moderate Solutions


## Unsure what to do with these passages

My contention is that it's important to distinguish between these two theories because they have ***diametrically opposed*** consequences for labor, a category which represents the economic lifeblood of the vast majority of the American people (and therefore determines the character of American society). To come right out with it: the infant-industry theory relies on suppressing wages, whereas the redistribution theory calls for increasing them. While it may be logically possible to support industrial policy on both grounds, if one does not distinguish between the two theories, then one will be unable to form an effective industrial policy that accomplishes *either* of the aims laid out previously.

If one is trying to help an industry that is currently non-competitive but promises to become so in the future, then one wants to direct all available resources within that industry towards investment. The basic problem an infant industry faces is that it cannot produce cheaply enough to survive against global competitors. In order for that industry to survive, it must either be insulated from global competition and developed exclusively within the domestic market--or it must be subsidized such that it can afford to sell below its marginal cost.
