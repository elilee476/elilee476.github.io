# The Political Economy of the Capital / Labor Trade

Vietnam is a relatively poor country with lots of young people. The United States is a wealthy country with lots of old people. If both countries have open economies, then we would expect, based on my stylized description, Vietnam to exchange labor for capital with the United States, i.e. for Vietnam to run a persistent trade surplus against the United States.

So far, so good. But what about when a country runs this trade *globally*? In this post I want to try to explain why the current administration, and actors from other parts of the political spectrum, think that there's a problem with this feature of our economy. The first thing to clarify is that the best versions of these arguments tend to focus on *political economy* rather than the straightforward measures of welfare (money) that most economists specializing in trade study. The concern is that trading capital for labor may affect the role of labor in American society in ways that disempower the former *even while it increases their economically-measured welfare*. 

The tl;dr of my take on this is that this *is* a valid concern, but the recently-announced tariffs, as well as the other prominent proposals to deal with these concerns, are not going to succesfully do what the concerned-parties want them to. That sounds very milquetoast, so I'll be more clear and say that I think most of this stuff is just a massive waste of money and/or just corruption aimed at enriching Trump or Biden's clients. 

A lot of people in both of these political coalitions have an instinct that this is the case, but they don't have the theoretical tools to explain why what's going on is bad. A big part of the problem is that the arguments typically used to defend free trade are only focused on welfare, which the capital-labor trade skeptics are not trying to maximize. In fact, most of them explicitly admit that their policies *will reduce welfare* but claim it's worth it because Americans are already wealthy and what they really need is to repair the political economy problem of disempowered labor. So I hope to make a contribution by stating arguments that share a willingness to prioritize political economy problems over welfare but nonetheless find a fatal mismatch between the policies and their objectives. 

## The Labor Economics of Trade in Mainstream Economic Theory

Economists have long been aware that production factor abundance gaps, namely the capital / labor abundance gaps that drive our trade surprlus, can cause negative consequences for labor. Put plainly, if a capital-rich labor-poor (these are relative comparisions) state trades with a labor-rich capital-poor state, then we would expect wages in the capital-rich state to fall. Consider an illustration of the prominent [Stolper-Samuelson theorem](https://are.berkeley.edu/~fally/Courses/Econ181Lecture4c.pdf), which one can read more about as a representative example of how lots of economists think about trade, below:

<img width="665" alt="Screen Shot 2025-04-03 at 17 30 31" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b649029-55c1-4a71-a261-2561ef6e4a81" />

Economists tend to think that the depicted wage decrease is fine because total welfare goes up. Since scarce resources get employed more productively--"the pie gets bigger." Any changes in ex ante distribution can be addressed through ex post redistribution--"more pie for everyone."

As the above tweet suggests, some people are cynical about this story. Awarding large gains to capital-owners who are already wealthy, at the *expense* of middle-class laborers––even when the size of the capitalist gains outweighs the losses of laborers, reinforces the collective action difficulties of redistribution[^1]. The amount of redistribution we choose is not exogenous wrt existing wealth distributions. In plain English, the more wealth gets concentrated in a few people's hands, the more power they have, and the better they will be able to prevent any redistribution to wider shares of the population. 

There's [some empirical support](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60342) for this being the right story to tell about the last 30 years of decreasing trade barriers:

Household incomes, *after* redistributive policies, haven't increased much for most Americans, even as the pie has gotten a lot bigger. So, you might think that redistributing gains to capital under free trade isn't very realistic because capitalists will use the additional power they acquire from their gains prevent exactly the redistribution that makes those gains worth it for laborers. Limiting trade may therefore look like a good––perhaps the only––way to maintain a high labor share even though it involves giving up some potential gains.

The question then is whether departures from classical free trade, like tariffs or subsidies, can address this issue. The first concern is that tariffs are more regressive than tax-and-transfer redistribution. The Trump administration has put forth some zany theories on tariff incidence based on FX markets, but the literature has documented clearly that tariffs have *some* incidence on consumption, and therefore are like any consumption tax, regressive.

Another issue is that the same political economy dynamics of political capture apply to tariffs. If tariffs are a second-best alternative to redistribution, then as soon as the wealthy realize this, they will use their anti-redistribution channels of political influence to prevent tariffs. Even if a momentary political coalition such as the current administration can maneuver around this, in the long run we wouldn't expect tariffs to be any more durable as a form of redistribution than tax-and-transfer schemes. 

## Infant Industry Theory

Another theory of tariffs focuses not on labor economics but rather on the notion of infant industry and comparative advantage. The classical theory of Ricardian trade, of which the Stolper-Samuelson theory discussed above is an additional gloss, says that states should have free trade because they will be most productive specializing in their strongest industries and should import the rest of their consumption basket by trading the output of their strong industries.

A prominent response to this recommendation is based on the notion that comparative advantage is not fixed and can in fact be *made* by states. For advanced forms of industrial production like computer chips or jet engines, a big component of comparative advantage is the existing expertise of the production community. A state could intentionally develop a community of producers who are knowledgeable about these industries through direct investment in R&D and by shielding the industry from superior foreign competitors until it has developed enough of a domestic comparative advantage for the industry to be profitable. That would eventually increase the total welfare of the economy by acquiring *new* comparative advantages. 

A truly classical economist would have to say that investors know this and price it in (hence we shouldn't see any market failures), but if you concede that investors can be nervous about making bold leaps on industries that may not be profitable for decades, then you can see why there might be a role for government intervention here. The prescription would then be for targeted tariffs and subsidies to help these industries thrive before they have built up enough expertise to compete on the world market. 

This theory is a much better fit with the Biden policies of subsidies in computer chips and EVs than it is for Trump's across the board tariffs. However, there is still a big problem as it applies to the actual long-run competitiveness of the targeted infant industries. That problem has to do with the underlying labor / capital abundance mismatch between the United States and its competitors. 

Here, when we talk about abundance, what we are really talking about is price. It doesn't matter how many laborers are actually available in the population if they are more *expensive* for an industry to employ. The price of labor is the laborer's wage. So, if wages are higher, then labor shows up as less abundant in the context of Stolper-Samuelson comparative advantage theorizing.

[stats]

The basic issue I'm driving at is that wages in the United States are much higher than our competitors in infant industry spaces like EVs or computer chips. So, even if you could develop as much existing expertise in those industries as counterparties like Germany, Japan, or China, it would still be cheaper to produce those products in those countries. Even where the expertise component of comparative advantage can be *matched* by infant industry support, you still have to deal with the labor component. As a structurally capital-abundant economy, it's unlikely the United States could ever be competitive on that front. 

This brings us to another point about the infant industry theory: it has ***diametrically opposed*** consequences for labor vs the redistribution-through-tariffs one. The infant-industry theory tends towards suppressing wages, whereas the redistribution theory calls for increasing them. 

If one is trying to help an industry that is currently non-competitive but promises to become so in the future, then one wants to direct all available resources within that industry towards investment. The basic problem an infant industry faces is that it cannot produce cheaply enough to survive against global competitors. In order for that industry to survive, it must either be insulated from global competition and developed exclusively within the domestic market--or it must be subsidized such that it can afford to sell below its marginal cost. 

In both cases, the greater the labor share of income for the industry, the slower it will eventually become competitive, and the more expensive it is to make it become so. Even if you can artifically increase labor compensation in ways that aren't incident on the industry (i.e. by labor subdidies), the cost of those subsidies will be incident on *other laborers* through taxation or inflation. The bottom line is that if one does not distinguish between the two theories, then one will be unable to form an effective industrial policy that accomplishes *either* of the aims laid out previously.

## A Materialist Account of Democracy

So far, we've seen that tariffs and subsidies don't look compelling from the persecptive of mainstream econ––neither as a substitute for redistribution or as a way of making infant industries eventually competitive. But since the premise of this post is that mainstream econ defenders of free trade are talking past their critics by focusing on welfare, we should now look at what the non-welfare considerations associated with tariffs are. 

Aristotle provides a primordial version of the political economy effects of different forms of production when he discusses the relationship between military strategy and form of government:

[aristotle quote]

The idea here is that when a state depends on a certain body of people for its defense, it is likely to award that body of people with advantages such as political agency and basic respect. I believe free trade critics have a similar instinct about economic production. The more labor plays a role in economic production 


## Constructive Moderate Solutions

That's because coordination is easier with small groups and because each potential defector weighs more strongly on the probability of the collective action succeeding.
