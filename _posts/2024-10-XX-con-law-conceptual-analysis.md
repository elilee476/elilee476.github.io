# Law School Con Law Classrooms and Conceptual Analysis: Brothers from Another Mother

## What is Conceptual Analysis?

An introductory philosophy course in the Anglophone world will typically begin with some version of the question "what is X?" At the first meeting of, say, an epistemology course, the professor will usually ask the students to consider "what is knowledge?" Something like "what is the good?" would be standard fare for an ethics course. 

This mode of inquiry has a name in analytic philosophy: it is generally known as "conceptual analysis." A more formal definition (which still probably wouldn't satisfy analytic philosophers) of conceptual analysis could be something like the effort to arrive at an a priori definition of a concept, especially as distinguished from an investigation of how real-world speakers use the term. In our example of epistemology, when the professor asks his students what knowledge is, he doesn't want to hear what the average English speaker appears to think the definition of knowledge is based on the phenomena that they use the term knowledge to describe. Instead, he wants a concept which could serve as a higher court above ordinary linguistics and potentially correct mistaken uses of the word.

Some philosophers in the analytic tradition have objected to the usual way that conceptual analysis is purused and have attempted to propose a more constuctive alternative. Summarizing a number of approaches at a high level, we could say the objection runs something like this:[^1] 

## An Objection to Conceptual Analysis

A typical way of doing conceptual analysis is that after a defintion for a concept like knowledge has been proposed, the analysts will test the concept by applying it to hypothetical situations and seeing what results it generates. Concepts will be accepted if their results as applied to these hypothetical situations accord with the intutions of the analytic commmunity, and they will be rejected if they generate results at odds with those intutitions. For example, if someone proposes that a just allocation of goods is one in which the sum of everyone's utility is maximized, an objector might reply by imagining a hypothetical situation in which a single person gets more utility from having *all* of a certain good than everyone else would get from having *any* of the good. This clearly *intuitively* strikes us as unjust, suggesting--according to the rules of this kind of conceptual analysis--that  utility maximization cannot be the correct concept of a just allocation of resources.[^2]  

The objection to the above method of conceptual analysis concerns the legitimacy of using the analysts' intutions to rule proposals in or out. Who is to say that our intutions can supply accurate information about whether a concept is right or not? And what do we mean by *our* intuitions? For example, monarchists might regard it as perfectly acceptable for justice to allow for one person in a society to have the entire share of certain goods like power or agency. Who is to say whose intuitions are right: the monarchists' or the center-left liberals' who tend to make up most analytic philosophy faculties? The fact that intutions differ across different communities makes it difficult to feel comfortable using any one particular community's intutions about a concept as a reliable guide to what that concept actually is.

One reaction to the above dilemmna is to simply dissolve conceptual analysis into socio-linguistic empirical investigation. We could content ourselves with collecting definitions for concepts that are implicit in various communities' differing intutions and make no attempt to decide which one of them is "right." 

Some analytic philosophers have pursued another route: while they take seriously the problem raised by the fact that different communities have diffent intuitions, they do not think that we should totally give up on evaluating which of intutions )and the concepts they imply) are more attractive or worthy of adoption. But rather than unreflectively espousing one community's intutions as the sovereign guide to right concepts, these analytic philosophers propose that we adopt usefulness in service of certain objectives as a guide for the formation of concepts. For example, in philosophy of science, rather than simply asking "what is evidence?" and then using one or another community's intutions to form the concept, we might try to form a concept of evidence that would be most helpful to the goals of pursuing of scientific knowledge or educating of future scientists. The point is that we aren't totally giving up on having a normative sense of what a concept's definition should be--we aren't surrending to mere documentation of how different people use different words--but nor are we simply assuming that concepts formed on the basis of Anlgophone philosophy departments' intutuitions should deign to correct everyone else's uses of concepts.

## A Familiar Skit from the Law School Classroom: "Dont Fight the Hypo"

The use of hypothetical situations--"hypos"--as a pedagogical method may remind those who have dealt with the legal academy of their own experiences. I'd like to describe a common way that hypos are used in the law school classroom, particularly in con law classes, and then pursue the thought that using hypos this way is vulnerable to a similar kind of objection as the one made above to conceptual analysis. My hypothetical dialogue, my *hypo*, will be devoid of all content and describe only the abstract intellectual moves that its participants make: 

1. Professor asks student to interpret a legal rule
2. Student proposes an interpretation of a legal rule
3. Professor creates a hypo in which the result of that interpretation is an outcome at odds with the moral or political preferences of the classroom
4. Student shamefully withdraws their interpretation of the legal rule
5. Professor proposes a refined interpretation of the rule in which the undesirable result is avoided
6. Classroom is shocked at professor's genuis, applauds

A specific instantiation of this skit often plays out between originalists and their antagonists. An originalist will assert that the 14th amendment's broad guarantees of rights should be interpreted as limited to the social practices that existed at the time of ratification. An originalist-antagonist will point out that schools were racially segregated in the very place (Washington DC) that the 14th amendment was ratified, making it impossible that the 14th amendment, if interpreted according to the originalist's principle, would protect the right to attend a racially integrated school as held in *Brown*. Since the originalist is often not spineless enough not to play the role of the humiliated student in the dialogue above, he will instead take on the role of the professor and propose some casuistic and ornate theory about how some constitutional clause or existing federal law actually already protects the right to integrated schools, rendering the antagonist's observation about segrated schools in 1868 DC less unpalatable.[^3] 

I hope the reader can already see that as in the case of conceptual analysis, we are dealing here with the same play of:
1. Empirical facts about current uses of something (a legal rule rather than a concept)
2. Intutions in a classroom
3. These use of those intuitions to search for a kind of higher normative authority that can stand above and guide real-world empirical behavior (in this case: intepretations of legal rules by courts).
