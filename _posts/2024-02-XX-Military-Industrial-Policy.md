The United States Department of Defense is both the largest employer and the government agency with the largest budget in the entire world. As the regulatory and business outlook for software companies' traditional lines of business (consumer advertising, consumer advertising, and consumer advertising) becomes [less compelling](https://www.google.com/search?q=bigtech+stock+down&oq=bigtech+stock+down&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIICAEQABgWGB4yCAgCEAAYFhgeMg0IAxAAGIYDGIAEGIoFMg0IBBAAGIYDGIAEGIoFMg0IBRAAGIYDGIAEGIoFMgoIBhAAGIAEGKIEMgoIBxAAGIAEGKIEMgoICBAAGIAEGKIE0gEIMjUwNGowajmoAgCwAgE&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) as a source of continued growth, it is reasonable for the tech industry to look toward military contracting as a new economic opportunity.

I am concerned about some of the public discourse that has been put promoted by tech companies pursuing the strategy I described in the previous paragraph. I'm a moderately right-of-center data-driven blogger, so I have no problem with corporations discharging their responsibility to their shareholders in whatever legally-compliant way they see fit. However, I would also want the fine readers of my blog to be equipped to identify the weaknesses of the arguments and thinking associated with the burgenoning "defense-tech" space. It is in that spirit that I would like to discuss several concerns I have with certain intellectual developments in the national security sphere.

*Eisenhower's response to the USSR's achievement of conventional military superiority in Western Europe*

Since the 2016 election and Washington's concommitant conversion to universal hawkishness on China, there have been calls from across the political spectrum to address the United States' lack of industrial capacity to engage in extended war. As far as I can tell, the idea here is basically that the United States has lost the ability to physically make a lot of the components necessary for producing enough materiel to replace stocks destroyed by extended combat with the PLA.

I find the idea that we would ever want to engage in extended all-out conflict with the PLA, and a fortiori that we should order our economy to be able to do this, utterly deranged. 

You can call me a squishy pacifist, but this position was actually shared by none other than President Eisenhower. The strategic situation facing Eisenhower was actually quite similar to the one that modern-day advocates of industrial policy perceive the United States to be in.

When I walk around the highly-unequal community of New Haven, which is in many ways a good metaphor for the segmentation of the United States into
