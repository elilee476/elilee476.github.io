# Introduction to a Series on American Imperial Decline

> Je tiens pour impossible que les grandes monarchies de l’Europe aient encore longtemps à durer: toutes ont brillé, et tout état qui brille est sur son déclin. J’ai de mon opinion des raisons plus particulières que cette maxime; mais il n’est pas à propos de les dire, et chacun ne les voit que trop.

The aim of this series is to provide the clearest and most compelling possible presentation of the thought that the United States is in a condition of imperial decline.

As the *Emile* passage suggests: alleging a condition of decline can be utterly banal. If invest any credibility in the metaphor of civilizations as living beings (this is Spengler, we will have much more to say about him later), or if we merely concede Ecclesiastes' assertion that all human things are impermanent, then we are forced to admit that *all* societies are *always* moving towards their inevitable demise. But the passage also mentions another possibility: "raisons plus particulières que cette maxime." In other (English) words, accusing a society of decline may be trite, but there is a lot more we can say that.
