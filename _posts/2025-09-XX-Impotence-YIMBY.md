# The Impotence of YIMBY Scolding

Most people who spend a lot of time online reading political commentary are aware of the terms "NIMBY" and "YIMBY" (here's a primer for the uninitiated).

 In this post, I hope to explain why I think it's mistaken to condemn homeowners for behaving as YIMBYs allege.
