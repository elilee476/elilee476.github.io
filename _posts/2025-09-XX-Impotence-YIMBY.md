# The Impotence of YIMBY Scolding

Most people who spend a lot of time online reading political commentary are aware of the terms "NIMBY" and "YIMBY." Here's a stylized version of a YIMBY story for what's wrong with many neighborhoods in American cities:

1. An existing neighborhood in a city consists mostly of single family houses or other low-density housing stock.
2. More people could move to the neighborhood if higher-density housing was built.
3. Existing homeowners don't want the additional housing, so they use their control of local government to prevent the construction of new housing stock.

ONe theory of what's wrong with this is distributional: this pattern of housing stock constriction benefits existing homeowners (the old and wealthy) at the expense of would-be homebuyers (the younger and less wealthy). Another theory is growth-based: since the utility of building new housing exceeds the cost to existing homeowners, this pattern constricts the total amount of wealth available for everyone in society to enjoy.

What I'd like to do in this post is use a concept from contract law called "efficient breach" to argue that 1) wherever existing homeowners actually prevent new construction, the distributional theory almost ipso facto applies and that 2) because the distributional theory is a better description of the situation, it's silly to criticize existing homeowners for their restrictive behavior. In fact, given certain reasonable assumptions that I'll detail later, their behavior may even be upholding economically rational outcomes.  

In the background of this debate is the Abundance book's effort to set a new center-left agenda around building more stuff: housing, trains, etc. The book uses YIMBYish arguments to indict the forces that restrict this building. A prominent response to the book's arguments has been to point out that a lack of public safety undermines people's support for public transportation and large housing developments. Eli Lee blog is not the place to openly indulge in such vulgar populism, so I will instead pursue my usual MO of using elementary law and economics concepts to implicitly support the latter position. 


## Efficient Breach

Let's begin with a brief overview of efficient breach.

## Conclusions

Now that we've seen how NIMBY behavior is often upholding economically rationality, we can develop several more specific critiques of the YIMBY / Abundance calls for more housing and public transportation.
