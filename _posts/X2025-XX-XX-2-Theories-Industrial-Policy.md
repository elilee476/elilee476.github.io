# Two More Theories of Industrial Policy and their Policy Consequences

In this brief post, I want to describe what I see as two important theories of industrial policy: one based on the notion of infant industries and another centered on the labor share (the percentage of GDP that is enjoyed by workers). In my last couple posts, I talked about the national security theory of industrial policy, which, at least in its current proposed forms, doesn't make any sense. That leaves these other two as prominent theories deserving of our attention.

## It's Time to BuildÂ©

A short story of the Asian tigers' succesful industrial policies could be something like this: subsidize promising industries in their infancy so that they have time to mature and become competitive on the global market. 

## Gini Moment 

I touched on this idea in the last section of my post on the national security justification for industrial policy.

## Why care

Anyone who has been trained in Anglophone philosophy becomes prone to making up and then insisting upon conceptual distinctions. Sometimes this is an overintellecualized indulgence, but conceptual distinctions can also help sharpen our thinking.

My contention is that it's important to distinguish between these two theories because they have ***diametrically opposed*** consequences for labor, a category which represents the economic lifeblood of the vast majority of the American people (and therefore determines the character of American society). To come right out with it: the infant-industry theory relies on suppressing wages, whereas the redistribution theory calls for increasing them. While it may be logically possible to support industrial policy on both grounds, if one does not distinguish between the two theories, then one will be unable to form an effective industrial policy that accomplishes *either* of the aims laid out previously.

If one is trying to help an industry that is currently non-competitive but promises to become so in the future, then one wants to direct all available resources within that industry towards investment. The basic problem an infant industry faces is that it cannot produce cheaply enough to survive against global competitors. In order for that industry to survive, it must either be insulated from global competition and developed exclusively within the domestic market--or it must be subsidized such that it can afford to sell below its marginal cost. 

In both cases, payments to laborers beyond their uncompetitive marginal productivity are likely to be borne by--guess who? Other laborers. The case of insulation from foreign competition is clear: tariffs are, like any consumption tax, regressive and thus will be paid by American labor (there aren't very many poor capitalists). Subsidies are more complicated because they are paid out from tax revenue. 

Or are they? The Biden Administration's brand of industrial policy involved large expenditures on borrowed (printed) money. Since that fiscal straegy tends to create inflation, which is again regressive, laborers are once again left with the check. But perhaps we could imagine instead paying for subsidies with highly progressive taxes. 

Here allow me to make a further conceptual distinction. Let's break down the required subsidies into two components:

- the quantity necessary to make the industry competitive given capital and labor costs equivalent to their marginal productivity
- the additional quantity necessary to compensate labor at prevailing or desirable rates

The idea here would be to pay laborers *above* their marginal product but to pass these costs onto the wealthy through progressive taxation. It's not that I don't think this could work, but more so that it is merely a dressed up version of a standard tax-and-transfer redistribution proposals. 

A more concrete approach would involve looking at successful Asian tigers' industrial policy. Wage suppression was a component of all of them, which is unlikely to be an accident.[^x] Asian tigers allowed their firms to hold down wages because they were trying to make production cheaper for firms.
