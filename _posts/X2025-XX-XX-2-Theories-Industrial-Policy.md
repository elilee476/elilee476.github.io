# Two More Theories of Industrial Policy and their Policy Consequences

In this brief post, I want to describe what I see as two important theories of industrial policy: one based on the notion of infant industries and another centered on the labor share (the percentage of GDP that is enjoyed by workers). In my last couple posts, I talked about the national security theory of industrial policy, which, at least in its current proposed forms, doesn't make any sense. That leaves these other two as prominent theories deserving of our attention.

A short story of the Asian tigers' succesful industrial policies could be something like this: subsidize promising industries in their infancy so that they have time to mature and become competitive on the global market. 

## Gini Moment 

I touched on this idea in the last section of my post on the national security justification for industrial policy.

## Why care

Anyone who has been trained in Anglophone philosophy becomes prone to making up and then insisting upon conceptual distinctions. Sometimes this is an overintellecualized indulgence, but conceptual distinctions can also help sharpen our thinking.

My contention is that it's important to distinguish between these two theories because they have ***diametrically opposed*** consequences for labor, a category which represents the economic lifeblood of the vast majority of the American people (and therefore determines the character of American society). To come right out with it: the infant-industry theory relies on suppressing wages, whereas the redistribution theory calls for increasing them. While it may be logically possible to support industrial policy on both grounds, if one does not distinguish between the two theories, then one will be unable to form an effective industrial policy that accomplishes *either* of the aims laid out previously.

If one is trying to help an industry that is currently non-competitive but promises to become so in the future, then one wants to direct all available resources within that industry towards investment. Both capital-investors––who will need to be subsidized by government for this very reason––and laborers must receive lower cashflows within the industry than they would otherwise earn in order for the theory to even apply. That's because for an industry to need government support in order to survive ***logically entails*** that investment in that industry is not a competitively-productive *current* use of marginal capital and labor resources. An infant-industry, definitionally, cannot currently produce cheaply enough to compete on the world market. The policy response that is called for is therefore to use a combination of subsidies, tariffs, and most importantly, wage suppression in order to allow the industry time to develop so that it can reach the global standard.

Let's look at this in the concrete case of successful Asian tigers' industrial policy. Wage suppression was a component of all of them, which is unlikely to be an accident.[^x] 

One could argue that all of the costs can be put on capital-investors and consumers such that no wage suppression would be necessary. Let's begin with the case of capital-investors. Although maintaining higher wages within an infant industry would increase costs, even *more* government
