# A comment regarding the NGAD

Today President Trump [revealed](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/trump-awards-boeing-much-needed-win-with-fighter-jet-contract-sources-say-2025-03-21/) a contract award for the Air Force's Next Generation Air Dominance program. The aircraft, called the F-47, will eventually replace (or supplement) the F-22 as our leading air superiority platform. While we didn't get much detail about what capabilities the aircraft will have, we do know about one interesting feature: **the F-47 will have a pilot**.

A lot of people responded to my [last post](https://elilee476.github.io/2025/02/20/Military-Industrial-Policy.html) with millenarian AI hype that, if true, would undermine my conclusion that cutting-edge chip production is not of national security importance to the United States. It's useful to recall here that on the most ambitious timeline, the F-47 will enter operation in around 2034, mass production a few years later, and then fly throughout the 2040s and 2050s. If we use [more recent Air Force projects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_F-35_Lightning_II_development) as a guide, that timeline could take as long as 30 years. I think it's interesting that the U.S. military does not believe AI will be sufficiently developed for unmanned combat operations by then.
